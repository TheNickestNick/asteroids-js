====BUGS====
Sometimes ship dies when you shoot an asteroid that's too close?

====FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT====
Re-evaluate use of quadtree for collisions?
Energy meters for guns, shields, and engines?
Use webgl instead of canvas 2d.
Audio for crashes and stuff.
More and better-balanced bonuses.
- Only two blue bonuses. (maybe all bonuses should be the same type?)
- Add bonuses for missiles and bombs.
-- Maybe nerf the heck out of missiles and bombs, actually, and require
   bonuses to get them back to the same level that they currently are. E.g.,
   reduce missile fire rate, but have a bonus that increases it. Maybe make
   bombs consumable, and you can pick them up by grabbing a bonus. We could
   also add other consumables (e.g., special types of missiles, a drone that
   flies around and shoots asteroids on your behalf, a shield that makes you
   temporarily invincible, etc.).
Exp and persistent rewards after you die.
- Maybe not persistent rewards, but make some % of your active bonuses fly
  out from your ship when you die, so you don't lose all of them? It's really
  frustrating to die on level 50 and have to start from scratch with astroids
  literally everywhere. You are basically dead at that point.
Better notifications for things like bonuses and level ups.
Cluster missiles instead of bombs.
Alien ships.
Homing missiles.
Dark asteroids.
Make multiple cannons spread less.
Nerf inertial brakes, maybe add a deceleration factor instead of a full-stop.
  This would also mean you could potentially benefit from collecting more than
  one inertial brakes bonus.
